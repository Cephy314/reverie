# Research Findings: Context Window Optimization for Propositions

## Executive Summary

Through comprehensive research combining academic literature and production system insights, we've developed a robust framework for optimizing context window usage when injecting proposition chains into LLM conversations. The key innovation is a **Proposition-to-Narrative (P2N)** service that transforms structured proposition graphs into coherent, token-efficient narratives while preserving semantic fidelity and managing cognitive load. This research validates that narrative generation from knowledge graphs significantly improves both token efficiency and LLM comprehension.

## Core Research Findings

### 1. Proposition Compression Without Semantic Loss

**Finding**: Abstractive summarization techniques from knowledge graphs can achieve significant compression while maintaining semantic integrity.

**Key Compression Strategies**:

1. **Relational Abstraction (Chain Roll-up)**:
   - Full chain: Multiple propositions with `evolves_from` relationships
   - Compressed: Single narrative capturing the evolution journey
   - Example: 3-proposition evolution chain → 1 sentence (3:1 compression)
   - Research shows this maintains the "why" of evolution, crucial for reasoning

2. **Semantic Pruning**:
   - Query-dependent relevance masking
   - Remove context-irrelevant proposition arguments
   - Example: `prefer(user, TypeScript, over: JavaScript, context: 'large projects', because: 'maintainability')`
   - For "What language?" → "The user prefers TypeScript" (80% reduction)

3. **Support Chain Aggregation**:
   - Multiple `supports` propositions → Single summarized evidence statement
   - Maintains logical structure while reducing token count

**Research Support**:
- ASGARD framework uses dual encoders (sequential + graph) for abstractive KG summarization
- ANTS achieves BLEU score of 5.78 for entity summarization beyond existing KG triples
- GraphRAG demonstrates thematic partitioning through community detection

- "From Local to Global: A GraphRAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization" (2024)

### 2. Cognitive Load Management for LLMs

**Finding**: Natural language is the lowest cognitive load format for LLMs, significantly outperforming structured data injection.

**Cognitive Load Hierarchy**:
1. **High Load**: Raw structured propositions requiring parsing
   - `p1: prefer(user, TS, over: JS); p2: supports(p1)`
   - Forces model to parse custom syntax before reasoning

2. **Low Load**: Coherent narrative presentation
   - "The user prefers TypeScript over JavaScript, primarily because..."
   - Allows model to focus on query-specific reasoning

**Quantitative Metrics for Cognitive Load**:

1. **Prompt Structural Density**:
   - Propositions per 1000 tokens
   - Relational complexity (link count)
   - Conceptual entropy (unique entities/predicates)

2. **Output Perplexity Monitoring**:
   - Spike detection indicates model confusion
   - Enables automated quality monitoring

3. **Chain-of-Thought Adherence**:
   - Measure deviation between reasoning and output
   - High deviation indicates excessive complexity

**Research Support**:
- IBM Research tutorial on "Storytelling from Structured Data and Knowledge Graphs" (ACL 2019)
- Studies show kinetic narratives benefit most from KG-based storytelling
- Introspective narratives (psychological depth) show limited improvement

### 3. Token Budgeting Strategies in Production

**Finding**: Production RAG systems use hierarchical token allocation with dynamic prioritization.

**Hierarchical Budget Allocation**:
```
- System Prompt & Instructions: 5-10% (fixed, high-priority)
- User Query: 5-10% (truncatable if excessive)
- Golden Context: 30-40% (highest relevance propositions)
- Supporting Context: 20-30% (nuance, compressible)
- Speculative Context: 10-15% (hypotheses, most expendable)
- Generation Headroom: 20-25% (critical for quality output)
```

**Dynamic Allocation Policies**:
- Factual queries: Maximize "Golden Context", minimize "Speculative"
- Exploratory queries: Increase "Speculative" allocation
- Complex reasoning: Balance all categories

**Cost Considerations**:
- RAG reduces token usage by 90%+ compared to full context injection
- Hybrid approaches combine RAG precision with deep-dive potential
- Intelligent routing layers optimize cost/latency trade-offs

### 4. Narrative Generation from Proposition Chains

**Finding**: Structured narrative generation significantly improves both comprehension and token efficiency.

**Narrative Generation Pipeline**:

1. **Relevance Scoring & Selection**:
   ```
   Score(p, q) = w1 * Sim(p, q) + w2 * Conf(p) + w3 * Recency(p) + w4 * Centrality(p)
   ```

2. **Thematic Clustering**:
   - Group propositions by semantic similarity
   - Enables coherent paragraph structure

3. **Causal/Temporal Sorting**:
   - `evolves_from` chains → temporal ordering
   - `supports/contradicts` → logical ordering

4. **Narrative Synthesis**:
   - Template-based or generative approaches
   - Style adaptation based on query type

**Narrative Styles by Query Type**:

1. **Factual Query**: `style: 'concise_summary'`
   - Direct, list-based presentation
   - Minimal explanatory text

2. **Exploratory Query**: `style: 'chronological_narrative'`
   - Story-like progression
   - Emphasis on evolution and learning

3. **Comparative Query**: `style: 'argumentative_synthesis'`
   - Presents multiple viewpoints
   - Highlights contradictions constructively

**Research Support**:
- Open-world story generation with structured knowledge shows improved coherence
- Knowledge graphs enable fine-grained control over narrative progression
- Compression ratios of 5:1 to 10:1 achievable for related proposition clusters

### 5. Confidence-Aware Narrative Generation

**Finding**: Linguistic hedging based on confidence scores is crucial for maintaining trust and accuracy.

**Confidence-to-Language Mapping**:
```
confidence > 0.9:    "The user knows/is certain that..."
confidence 0.7-0.9:  "The user believes/thinks..."
confidence 0.5-0.7:  "There are indications that..."
confidence < 0.5:    "The user is exploring the idea that..."
hypothesis:          "A tentative thought is..."
```

**Example Narrative with Mixed Confidence**:
> "The user has well-established experience with React [0.99], which they learned in 2021 and used on the 'Acme' project [0.95]. There are strong indications they encountered challenges with state management [0.80], leading them to explore alternatives like Redux and MobX [0.60]. They subsequently adopted Redux for the 'NewCo' project [0.98]."

**Handling Contradictions**:
- Present as insights, not errors
- "While you successfully delivered X, there is a conflicting memory of frustration with Y"
- Transforms data conflicts into valuable understanding
