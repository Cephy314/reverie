# Research Findings: Proposition Dynamics & Graph Evolution

## Executive Summary

Through comprehensive research combining academic literature and production system insights, we've developed a robust framework for managing proposition dynamics in Reverie's dual-graph architecture. The key innovation is treating propositions as first-class citizens with well-defined lifecycles, relationships, and confidence propagation mechanisms. This research validates that the proposition-centric approach aligns with established theories in argumentation, temporal reasoning, and belief revision while remaining pragmatically implementable.

## Core Research Findings

### 1. Proposition Relationships vs Entity Relationships

**Finding**: Proposition relationships fundamentally differ from entity relationships by operating at a meta-level, describing how claims relate rather than facts about entities.

**Key Relationship Taxonomy**:

1. **Argumentative/Rhetorical Relations** (Based on Dung's Argumentation Framework, 1995):
   - `supports/provides_evidence_for`: P1 strengthens belief in P2
   - `contradicts/attacks`: P1 undermines belief in P2
   - `explains/causes`: P1 provides causal reasoning for P2
   - `generalizes/instantiates`: P1 is an abstract form of P2

2. **Temporal Relations** (From Temporal Knowledge Graph Research):
   - `supersedes`: P1 replaces P2 as the current belief
   - `evolves_from`: P1 is a refined version of P2
   - `co-occurs_with`: P1 and P2 are temporally correlated

3. **Logical Relations** (From Toulmin Model):
   - `warrants`: P1 justifies the inference of P2
   - `qualifies`: P1 limits the scope of P2
   - `rebuts`: P1 provides exceptions to P2

**Implementation Approach**: Use reification pattern where propositions are nodes with edges representing these meta-relationships. This is proven in production systems like Google's Knowledge Graph.

### 2. Cross-Graph Influence Patterns

**Finding**: The interaction between Personal and Domain Knowledge Graphs requires careful trust boundaries and promotion mechanisms.

**Pattern A: Bottom-Up Promotion (Personal → Domain)**

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. Consensus threshold: N users assert similar propositions
2. Authority validation: Expert user confirms proposition
3. Temporal stability: Proposition remains unchanged for T time

**Implementation Pipeline**:
```
1. Pattern Detection: Scan Personal KGs for recurring patterns
2. Hypothesis Generation: Create Domain KG hypothesis with confidence score
3. Evidence Linking: Connect source propositions via 'is_evidence_for'
4. Threshold Promotion: Elevate to 'confirmed' when confidence > threshold
```

**Pattern B: Top-Down Seeding (Domain → Personal)**

**Use Cases**:
- New user onboarding with domain best practices
- Context change detection (e.g., starting new project)
- Learning acceleration through validated patterns

**Trust Boundaries** (Based on research):
- User assertions about self: High trust (0.9)
- User assertions about technology: Medium trust (0.6)
- Domain assertions: Variable trust based on source authority

**References**:
- AGM Postulates (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, Makinson, 1985) for belief revision
- HybridRAG approaches showing success of dual-system architectures

### 3. Temporal Conflict Resolution

**Finding**: Append-only architecture with validity intervals provides the most robust solution for tracking belief evolution.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Temporal Annotation**:
   ```
   Proposition: {
     content: "prefer(user, TypeScript, over: JavaScript)",
     valid_from: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
     valid_until: "infinity",
     confidence: 0.8
   }
   ```

2. **Conflict Detection Algorithm**:
   - New proposition P_new arrives
   - Query for conflicting propositions where valid_until = infinity
   - Identify conflicts based on predicate and subject matching

3. **Resolution Process**:
   - Set P_old.valid_until = P_new.valid_from
   - Create edge: (P_new) --supersedes--> (P_old)
   - Maintain full history for temporal queries

**Research Support**:
- Temporal Knowledge Graphs (RE-GCN, TRCL models) show 11.46% improvement in reasoning with temporal modeling
- Event Calculus principles provide formal foundation for state transitions

### 4. Hypothesis Lifecycle Management

**Finding**: Propositions exist on a confidence spectrum requiring state machine management.

**Lifecycle States** (Validated by Cerbere Production System):

1. **PROPOSED** (confidence: 0.0-0.3)
   - Initial assertion or system-generated hypothesis
   - Actively seeking evidence

2. **SEEKING_EVIDENCE** (confidence: 0.3-0.5)
   - System prompts for clarification
   - Monitors for supporting/contradicting events

3. **SUPPORTED** (confidence: 0.5-0.7)
   - Multiple evidence sources identified
   - Confidence increasing but not definitive

4. **CONFIRMED** (confidence: 0.7-1.0)
   - Strong evidence accumulated
   - Ready for reasoning and propagation

5. **REFUTED** (confidence: -1.0-0.0)
   - Contradictory evidence dominates
   - Maintained as "known false" to prevent repetition

**State Transition Events**:
- User actions (project completion, tool adoption)
- External observations (article reading, bug encounters)
- Temporal decay (reduced confidence over time without reinforcement)

### 5. Confidence Propagation Mechanisms

**Finding**: Simplified belief propagation outperforms complex Bayesian networks in dynamic graphs.

**Propagation Formula**:
```
For edge (P1)--[supports, weight: w]->(P2):
  delta_confidence = (new_conf_P1 - old_conf_P1) * w * decay_factor
  new_conf_P2 = clamp(old_conf_P2 + delta_confidence, -1.0, 1.0)
```

**Key Parameters**:
- Edge weights: Strength of relationship (0.0-1.0)
- Decay factor: Distance-based attenuation (e.g., 0.8^depth)
- Propagation threshold: Minimum delta to trigger update (e.g., 0.05)

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Use asynchronous propagation to prevent blocking
- Implement cycle detection to avoid infinite loops
- Cache propagation paths for efficiency

## Production System Insights

### Scalable Alternatives to Pure Event Calculus

1. **Rule Engines** (e.g., Drools CEP):
   - Model propositions as Facts
   - State transitions as Rules
   - Proven in production at scale

2. **Event-Driven Architectures**:
   - Kafka/Kinesis for event streams
   - State machines in application services
   - Graph database for persistent state

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Neo4j for graph storage
   - Apache Flink for stream processing
   - Redis for confidence score caching

## Key Insights

The shift from entity-centric to proposition-centric knowledge representation is more than a technical detail—it fundamentally changes how we model belief and reasoning. By combining established theoretical frameworks with pragmatic implementation approaches, we can build a system that:

- Models how beliefs actually evolve (not just current state)
- Propagates confidence through logical relationships
- Bridges personal experience with collective knowledge
- Scales to production workloads

The research strongly validates that proposition dynamics, when properly implemented, can create a memory system that truly augments human reasoning in LLM conversations.
